# e3DHW-PMS
Power Management System is a simple and general project methodology which, within the e3DHW vision, solves many problems related to the power supply of DIY electronic devices flexibly.

e3DHW-PMS (e3DHW- Power Management System) has the following objectives:
- Very simple, cheap and substantially similar power supply circuit for all DIY electronic devices. 
- In mains operations the batteries are used as buffer batteries, therefore UPS units are not required for 7/24 operation.
- Operation as a portable device periodically requires a recharge phase.
- Possibility to change the energy source in real-time without modifying the circuit: the same device will work with batteries, with the grid, with solar panels, with 12 V car, etc ... without circuit modifications.
